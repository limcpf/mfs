# Everything-Is-A-Markdown (EIAM)

Language: **English** | [한국어](README.ko.md)

Everything-Is-A-Markdown is a CLI tool that turns a local Markdown vault into a static website while keeping the folder/file navigation experience.

## What This App Is For

- Build a static docs/blog site from your Markdown vault
- Publish only documents with `publish: true`
- Keep private notes and public content separate

## Works Great with Obsidian

- You can keep writing in Obsidian and publish selected notes.
- Obsidian-style wikilinks (`[[...]]`) are supported.

## Install

```bash
bun install
```

## Usage

```bash
bun run blog [build|dev|clean] [options]
```

Commands:

- `bun run build`: Build static files
- `bun run dev`: Run local dev server (default `http://localhost:3000`)
- `bun run clean`: Remove `dist` and `.cache`

Common options:

- `--vault <path>`: Markdown root directory (default `.`)
- `--out <path>`: Output directory (default `dist`)
- `--exclude <glob>`: Add exclude pattern (repeatable)
- `--port <n>`: Dev server port (default `3000`)

Examples:

```bash
# Run with the sample vault
bun run dev -- --vault ./test-vault --out ./dist

# Build
bun run build -- --vault ./test-vault --out ./dist
```

## Markdown Frontmatter

- `branch: dev`  
  Branch filter label.
- `description: "..."`  
  Short summary.
- `tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]`  
  String array.
